earlier this year, the question came up as to whether the box office
drop from the opening to the 2nd weekend was normal, or whether it
dropped more than it should have due to bad word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get hold of some data from the BoxOffice Mojo website to
try and answer this question, and it then also evolved into an exercise
in data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was all obtained from BoxOfficeMojo using a couple of web
scraping scripts. For additional details, as well as known issues, see
more at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/simonb83/DataScienceIntensive/tree/master/projects/box-office"&gt;https://github.com/simonb83/DataScienceIntensive/tree/master/projects/box-office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-does-success-mean"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does success mean&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality we see that films can be successful in different ways
depending on the metric we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at box office takings for the opening weekend then, as
expected, Sci-Fi, Action and Animated are the genres that typically
dominate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if we also take budget into account, then it turns out that
Horror films are particularly successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image2.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look into why this might be, we see that on average Horror films
have a budget one quarter of the size of that for Action, SciFi and
Animated films, so it is much easier for them to make their money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image3" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look further into budgets we see that they have increased
steadily since the 1980s in both nominal and adjusted terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image4" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image4.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the average opening weekend takings seem to have been
on a slight downward trend since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image5" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be because the total number of films released has almost
doubled since 2000, pushing down the box office average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image6" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image6.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of total takings, the vast majority of releases make less than
$25 million in their opening weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image7" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image7.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst ‘blockbusters’ continue&amp;nbsp; to break box office records on a regular
basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image8" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image8.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, films drop by about 40% in Box Office takings between their
opening and second weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image9" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image9.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are films that actually increase their box office
takings in their second weekend, although these are typically from more
obscure genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image10" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image10.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="batman-vs-superman"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Batman vs Superman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we look at the Batman vs Superman film in more detail and compare
with two specific films:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avengers: Civil War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Batman: Dark Knight Rises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use a general group consisting of 89 Sci-Fi and Action/Adventure
films, with budget &amp;gt; 100 million USD, released since 2010.Batman vs.
Superman performed very well in its opening weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image11" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image11.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also within the top 10 films with a highest grossing opening
weekend based on our comparison group:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image12" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image12.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, by the second weekend it did a lot worse than its peers,
dropping nearly 70% vs. an average drop of 50% for similar films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image13" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image13.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we look at a couple of very simple scenarios for how well BvS
could have performed in its second weekend, had it not dropped more than
average vs. its peer group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that it could have made an additional $12-30 million in its
second weekend had it performed similar to comparative films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image14" src="https://simonb83.github.io/images/box_office_image14.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
